Homily Example: “The Power of Seeing as God Sees”
(Approx. 1000 words)
Gospel Reading: Mark 10:46–52 — The Healing of Blind Bartimaeus

In today’s Gospel, we meet a man sitting by the roadside — Bartimaeus, the blind beggar. He’s a familiar figure to anyone who’s walked through a busy city or market: the person who sits on the margins, unseen, unheard, passed by. And yet, in this encounter between Bartimaeus and Jesus, something extraordinary happens — something that reveals not only the compassion of Christ, but the heart of the Gospel itself.
Bartimaeus is blind, but he sees something that others around him do not. When he hears that Jesus of Nazareth is passing by, he begins to shout, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” The crowd tells him to be quiet — to stay in his place, to stop making noise, to stop interrupting. But he refuses to be silenced. He cries out even louder, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
And Jesus stops.
That, right there, is one of the most beautiful sentences in the Gospel: “And Jesus stopped.”
 In a world that’s always rushing — from one task to another, one notification to the next — Jesus stops for one man on the side of the road.
He doesn’t rush past. He doesn’t let the noise drown the cry. He stops — and he listens.

1. The Courage to Cry Out
Bartimaeus gives us the first lesson: the courage to cry out.
 He knows he is blind; he knows he needs help. That’s not weakness — that’s wisdom. How often do we go through life pretending we can see just fine, when in fact our spiritual vision is clouded by fear, pride, or distraction?
Bartimaeus refuses to hide his need. He doesn’t care what others think; he doesn’t care that they’re annoyed. He cries out from his poverty — and that is exactly what moves the heart of Christ.
There’s a powerful honesty in that cry: “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.” It’s the simplest prayer in the world, and maybe the most perfect one. It doesn’t try to impress. It doesn’t explain. It just calls out for mercy — for the love that only God can give.
When was the last time you prayed like that? Not out of routine, but from the gut — when you were really honest about your need for God’s mercy?
 Bartimaeus shows us that faith begins not with certainty, but with need. It begins when we have the courage to cry out, even when the crowd tells us not to.

2. Jesus Calls Him by Name
When Jesus hears Bartimaeus, He doesn’t call out to him directly. Instead, He says to the crowd, “Call him here.”
And suddenly, the same crowd that was silencing Bartimaeus becomes the messenger of hope:
 “Take heart; get up, He is calling you.”
Isn’t that just like the way God works? He transforms the voices of discouragement into voices of invitation.
 Sometimes the very people who once dismissed us end up carrying the message of grace.
When Bartimaeus hears that call, he throws aside his cloak and runs to Jesus. The cloak would have been his most valuable possession — the thing that kept him warm at night and collected coins during the day. But he leaves it behind without hesitation. That’s faith in action. He trusts that what awaits him in Jesus is far greater than what he’s leaving behind.
Jesus then asks him a question that, on the surface, seems unnecessary:
 “What do you want me to do for you?”
Surely it’s obvious — Bartimaeus is blind! And yet, Jesus wants him to name it. Because when we speak our desire aloud, it becomes real. It becomes a prayer, an act of faith.
 Bartimaeus answers, “Master, I want to see.”
It’s such a simple request — and yet, it’s the heart of discipleship. To see. To see rightly. To see as God sees.

3. The Gift of True Sight
Jesus responds, “Go; your faith has saved you.” And immediately, Bartimaeus regains his sight — and follows Jesus on the way.
Notice the order: he doesn’t just receive his sight; he becomes a disciple. He doesn’t return to his old life; he joins the road to Jerusalem, the road that leads to the Cross.
That’s what true healing does — it sends us on mission.
 Bartimaeus doesn’t just see the world differently; he lives differently. His eyes are opened not only to light, but to love. He’s not a beggar anymore; he’s a follower of Christ.
And that’s the kind of vision Jesus wants to give each of us.
Because, if we’re honest, we all have our blind spots. We all have places in our hearts we’d rather not see — pain we avoid, prejudice we justify, people we overlook. Sometimes our blindness is not physical, but spiritual or emotional. We stop seeing the poor, the lonely, the inconvenient. We stop seeing beauty in the ordinary, or the face of Christ in the person next to us.
Jesus wants to open our eyes — to restore our sight, so that we can see the world through His eyes: eyes of compassion, mercy, and hope.

4. The Call to See as Christ Sees
This Gospel invites us to ask the same question Bartimaeus did:
 “Lord, that I may see.”
See what?
 See the person in front of me not as a problem but as a gift.
 See myself not as unworthy but as beloved.
 See the world not as hopeless but as redeemable.
To see as God sees is to notice the person everyone else ignores. It’s to stop, as Jesus did, when someone cries out for help. It’s to look at our own lives and recognize where we need mercy — and then to bring that same mercy to others.
When we begin to see like that, we stop living at the surface. We stop rushing past people and moments. We start noticing grace — the quiet ways God is present even in our struggles.

5. A Word for Today
Brothers and sisters, we live in a noisy world. There are so many voices shouting for our attention — politics, social media, fear, competition. It’s easy to lose sight of what truly matters. But the Gospel today reminds us: the voice that changes everything is the one that cries, “Jesus, have mercy on me.”
And the heart that changes everything is the one that stops — as Jesus did — and listens.
So maybe this week, our prayer is simple:
 “Lord, help me to see.”
 Help me to see the person who’s hurting.
 Help me to see the opportunities for kindness I’ve overlooked.
 Help me to see my own need for healing — and to bring it to You.
Because when we see as God sees, everything changes. The blind beggar becomes a disciple. The road of suffering becomes the path to salvation. And the ordinary world becomes radiant with grace.

Conclusion
At the end of the story, Bartimaeus is no longer sitting by the road. He’s walking on it — following Jesus.
That’s the journey of every Christian life: from the side of the road to the road itself; from blindness to sight; from begging to belonging.
May we, like Bartimaeus, have the courage to cry out, the faith to follow, and the grace to see — as God sees.
Amen.
